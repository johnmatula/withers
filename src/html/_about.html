      <p class="about__summary">Through speech and movement, I am inspired to take words off a page and weave a story. I am inspired to make great art with others who aspire to take the next step in our storytelling. When we work together as artists, we not only entertain, but we also let the person who needs to hear it the most that they are seen and heard. <strong>Want to hear a story? Let’s tell it together.</strong></p>
